# K-RITE Final Assignment - Project Guidelines

This project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following specific guidelines. Below are the steps to set up and run the project:

## Setup Instructions

1. **Project Directory Setup**: Begin by creating a dedicated folder on your computer where you'll organize all project files. Choose a descriptive name for the folder.

2. **File Creation**: Inside the project folder, create the following files:
   - `index.html`: Main HTML file.
   - `styles.css`: CSS file for styling.
   - `script.js`: JavaScript file for any interactive functionality (optional if not needed).

3. **Code Implementation**: Utilize a text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text to write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Ensure to structure your HTML file properly, apply styles in the CSS file, and add any necessary scripts in the JavaScript file.

4. **Linking Files**: In the `index.html` file, link the CSS and JavaScript files within the `<head>` tag:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

## Running the Project

To view your project:

1. **Preview**: Double-click on the `index.html` file in your project folder. This action should open the file in your default web browser, allowing you to visualize your webpage.

2. **Debugging and Editing**: As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, remember to save them and refresh your browser to see the updates. Utilize the browser's developer tools for debugging purposes.

## Deployment

If you wish to share your project with others:

1. **Hosting**: Deploy your project to a web server. Consider using hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, which offer free or low-cost options for hosting static websites.

2. **Sharing**: Share the deployed link with others to access your project online.



By following these steps, you can successfully set up, run, and deploy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based project.
